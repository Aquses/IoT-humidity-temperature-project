# Temperature and humidity sensor measurer

Project for the course Introduction to Applied IoT, Summer 2024

**Name:** Eldaras Zutautas <br>
**Student:** ez222eq

# Short project overview
For this project, I constructed a sensor node using a Raspberry Pi Pico W that reports temperature and humidity every hour to ThingSpeak, a free service that facilitates communication with internet-enabled devices.

**Approxiamtion of time needed for the project:**

Up to 2-3 hours total

# Objective
**Reasons for choosing the project:**
I chose this project because I've always felt that my room becomes very dry during the summer. I wanted to verify this, so I decided to create a sensor node to measure the actual humidity levels.

**Purposes of the project:**
The main objective of this project is twofold. Firstly, it aims to provide a learning experience about the Internet of Things (IoT), including understanding how to construct an IoT device and connect it to a platform for visualizing its data. Secondly, it seeks to manage and monitor the room's humidity and temperature.

**Insights gained by doing the project:**
The project offers an opportunity to gain an understanding of fundamental concepts in IoT and electrical circuits, providing valuable insights into these areas.

# Material
Component | Purpose    
-| -|
ESP8266 | A microcontroller used for data collection, data transfer, and data analysis. 
DHT11 | A sensor used for mesuring the humidity in the air asweel as the temperature 
5x Jumper wires | Wires for connecting the different components
Breadboard 800 points | A board used to easy connect the sensors without soldering 
Micro USB cable | Connection between ESP8266 and a computer

I bought the Linnaeus Development kit for 399 SEK, so it had all of these components included.



# Computer setup
**Setting up the IDE:**

The first step was to decide which IDE to use. I chose Visual Studio Code. After installing it, I also installed the MicroPython extension to work with the Raspberry Pi Pico.
