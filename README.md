# Temperature and humidity sensor measurer

Project for the course Introduction to Applied IoT, Summer 2024

**Name:** Eldaras Zutautas <br>
**Student:** ez222eq

# Short project overview
In this project I built a sensor node with an Rasperry Pi Pico Wh that publishes the temperature and humidity every hour to a free service called ThingSpeak which allows users to communicate with internet enabled devices.

**Approxiamtion of time needed for the project:**

Up to 2-3 hours total

# Objective
**Reasons for choosing the project:**
The reason I choose this project is that I always felt that my room was very dry during the summer, so I decided to create this project to see, if my room is actually that dry.

**Purposes of the project:**
The main objective of this project is twofold. Firstly, it aims to provide a learning experience about the Internet of Things (IoT), including understanding how to construct an IoT device and connect it to a platform for visualizing its data. Secondly, it aims to manage and monitor the humidity and the temperature of the room.

**Insights gained by doing the project:**
The project offers an opportunity to gain an understanding of fundamental concepts in IoT and electrical circuits. It provides insights into these areas of knowledge.

# Material
Component | Purpose    
-| -|
ESP8266 | A microcontroller used for data collection, data transfer, and data analysis. 
DHT11 | A sensor used for mesuring the humidity in the air asweel as the temperature 
5x Jumper wires | Wires for connecting the different components
Breadboard 800 points | A board used to easy connect the sensors without soldering 
Micro USB cable | Connection between ESP8266 and a computer

I bought the Linnaeus Development kit for 399 SEK, so it had all of these components included.
